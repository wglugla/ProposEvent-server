# ProposEvent-server

Backend to the project **ProposEvent**

## Backend requirements

## Shortcut of the app idea

User creates account which allows him to:

- create new event and invite people to take part in it
- take part in an event created by someone

Events are selected by tags connected with your account and each event.
